- adaptive thresholding based on local region
  * alignment pattern locator
  * bit reader
- Better homography
  * Find edges of squares.then use directory or intersections to compute homogrpahy
  * Don't rely on features as much
- Mark bits which are ambiguous as being omitted
  * Might be able to correct more bits this way



=================== FUTURE ==================================
- Don't require alignment patterns
- New position pattern detector
  * Horizontal scan line
  * Find stone inside
  * Determine radius by looking for blobs around it
- Using crude position patterns...
  * Using shape estimate location of timing pattern and use that to determine version and initial homography estimate
= Read bits using edge image some how?
