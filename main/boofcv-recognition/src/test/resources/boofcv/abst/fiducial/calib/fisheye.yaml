# Omnidirectional camera model with radial and tangential distortion
# C. Mei, and P. Rives. "Single view point omnidirectional camera calibration from planar grids."  ICRA 2007
# (fx,fy) = focal length, (cx,cy) = principle point, (width,height) = image shape
# mirror_offset = offset mirror along z-axis in unit circle
# radial = radial distortion, (t1,t2) = tangential distortion
